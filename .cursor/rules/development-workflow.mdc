# Development Workflow

## Change Tracking

Before implementing any functional change (new feature, behavioral modification, or significant refactor), create a **proposal** and **spec** first. This ensures changes are reviewed, tracked, and well-documented before code is written.

- Use the OpenSpec workflow (proposal → spec → implementation) for all non-trivial changes.
- Hotfixes and typo-level corrections are exempt.

## Test Coverage

Every functional code change MUST include corresponding test updates:

- Add or update unit/integration tests to cover the changed behavior.
- Aim for maximum practical coverage — all branches, edge cases, and error paths.
- All existing and new tests MUST pass before considering the change complete.
- Run tests after implementation; do not defer testing to a later step.

## Design Philosophy

Favor **long-term value** over short-term speed:

- Design for extensibility — anticipate future requirements and avoid painting into corners.
- Follow established best practices, proven patterns, and industry-standard approaches.
- Prefer modular, pluggable architectures over monolithic quick-fixes.
- When trade-offs exist between "fast to ship" and "right to maintain", choose maintainability.
