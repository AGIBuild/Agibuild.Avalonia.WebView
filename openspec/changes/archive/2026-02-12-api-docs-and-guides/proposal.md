# API Docs and Guides

**Goal**: E3
**ROADMAP**: Phase 3.6 + 3.7

## Problem

No API reference site or structured documentation. Developers lack Getting Started, Bridge, SPA Hosting, and Architecture guides.

## Solution

API reference site via docfx configured for Core, Runtime, and WebView projects. Enable `GenerateDocumentationFile` globally; disable for tests and benchmarks. Four guide articles: Getting Started, Bridge, SPA Hosting, Architecture.
