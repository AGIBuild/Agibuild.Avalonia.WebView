# minimal-hybrid-sample

**Goal**: G2
**ROADMAP**: Phase 2, Deliverable 2.8

## Problem

No example showing minimal hybrid app usage. Developers cannot quickly see how to wire bridge calls in a simple scenario without build tools.

## Proposed Solution

Vanilla JS sample at `samples/minimal-hybrid/` demonstrating bridge calls without build tools. Single HTML file with inline JS, modern UI, and clear call flow.
