## Why

Phase 5 technical milestones are complete, but roadmap status and evidence references are still in an in-progress posture. This creates governance ambiguity for release and next-phase planning.

## What Changes

- Update Phase 5 state in roadmap from in-progress to completed.
- Refresh latest evidence snapshot to current full-gate baseline.
- Add explicit evidence source mapping for Phase 5 closeout to reduce interpretation drift.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- None.

### Modified Capabilities

- `electron-replacement-foundation`: add explicit closeout-state and evidence mapping requirements for Phase 5 governance.

## Impact

- Affected OpenSpec roadmap and foundation spec statements.
- No runtime behavior changes.
- Improves release auditability and next-stage planning confidence.

## Non-goals

- No feature development.
- No CI pipeline behavior changes in this change.
- No contract surface expansion.
