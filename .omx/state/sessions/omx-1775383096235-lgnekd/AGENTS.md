# Everything Claude Code (ECC) — Agent Instructions

This is a **production-ready AI coding plugin** providing 28 specialized agents, 125 skills, 60 commands, and automated hook workflows for software development.

**Version:** 1.9.0

## Core Principles

1. **Agent-First** — Delegate to specialized agents for domain tasks
2. **Test-Driven** — Write tests before implementation, 80%+ coverage required
3. **Security-First** — Never compromise on security; validate all inputs
4. **Immutability** — Always create new objects, never mutate existing ones
5. **Plan Before Execute** — Plan complex features before writing code
6. **聊天回复总是使用中文回复。代码文件必须使用英文。
7. 聊天回复用通俗易懂的语言描述，语言简洁清晰明了， 避免大段落的重复废话。
8. 子代理只能权衡使用5.4或者5.3 code模型，

## Agent Orchestration

Use agents proactively without user prompt:
- Complex feature requests → **planner**
- Code just written/modified → **code-reviewer**
- Bug fix or new feature → **tdd-guide**
- Architectural decision → **architect**
- Security-sensitive code → **security-reviewer**
- Multi-channel communication triage → **chief-of-staff**
- Autonomous loops / loop monitoring → **loop-operator**
- Harness config reliability and cost → **harness-optimizer**

Use parallel execution for independent operations — launch multiple agents simultaneously.

## Security Guidelines

**Before ANY commit:**
- No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- All user inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- CSRF protection enabled
- Authentication/authorization verified
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Error messages don't leak sensitive data

**Secret management:** NEVER hardcode secrets. Use environment variables or a secret manager. Validate required secrets at startup. Rotate any exposed secrets immediately.

**If security issue found:** STOP → use security-reviewer agent → fix CRITICAL issues → rotate exposed secrets → review codebase for similar issues.

## Coding Style

**Immutability (CRITICAL):** Always create new objects, never mutate. Return new copies with changes applied.

**File organization:** Many small files over few large ones. 200-400 lines typical, 800 max. Organize by feature/domain, not by type. High cohesion, low coupling.

**Error handling:** Handle errors at every level. Provide user-friendly messages in UI code. Log detailed context server-side. Never silently swallow errors.

**Input validation:** Validate all user input at system boundaries. Use schema-based validation. Fail fast with clear messages. Never trust external data.

**Code quality checklist:**
- Functions small (<50 lines), files focused (<800 lines)
- No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- Proper error handling, no hardcoded values
- Readable, well-named identifiers

## Testing Requirements

**Minimum coverage: 80%**

Test types (all required):
1. **Unit tests** — Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration tests** — API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E tests** — Critical user flows

**TDD workflow (mandatory):**
1. Write test first (RED) — test should FAIL
2. Write minimal implementation (GREEN) — test should PASS
3. Refactor (IMPROVE) — verify coverage 80%+

Troubleshoot failures: check test isolation → verify mocks → fix implementation (not tests, unless tests are wrong).

## Development Workflow

1. **Plan** — Use planner agent, identify dependencies and risks, break into phases
2. **TDD** — Use tdd-guide agent, write tests first, implement, refactor
3. **Review** — Use code-reviewer agent immediately, address CRITICAL/HIGH issues
4. **Capture knowledge in the right place**
   - Personal debugging notes, preferences, and temporary context → auto memory
   - Team/project knowledge (architecture decisions, API changes, runbooks) → the project's existing docs structure
   - If the current task already produces the relevant docs or code comments, do not duplicate the same information elsewhere
   - If there is no obvious project doc location, ask before creating a new top-level file
5. **Commit** — Conventional commits format, comprehensive PR summaries

## Git Workflow

**Commit format:** `<type>: <description>` — Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

**PR workflow:** Analyze full commit history → draft comprehensive summary → include test plan → push with `-u` flag.

## Architecture Patterns

**API response format:** Consistent envelope with success indicator, data payload, error message, and pagination metadata.

**Repository pattern:** Encapsulate data access behind standard interface (findAll, findById, create, update, delete). Business logic depends on abstract interface, not storage mechanism.

**Skeleton projects:** Search for battle-tested templates, evaluate with parallel agents (security, extensibility, relevance), clone best match, iterate within proven structure.

## Performance

**Context management:** Avoid last 20% of context window for large refactoring and multi-file features. Lower-sensitivity tasks (single edits, docs, simple fixes) tolerate higher utilization.

**Build troubleshooting:** Use build-error-resolver agent → analyze errors → fix incrementally → verify after each fix.

## MCP Servers

Treat the project-local `.codex/config.toml` as the default Codex baseline for ECC. The current ECC baseline enables GitHub, Context7, Exa, Memory, Playwright, and Sequential Thinking; add heavier extras in `~/.codex/config.toml` only when a task actually needs them.

### Automatic config.toml merging

The sync script (`scripts/sync-ecc-to-codex.sh`) uses a Node-based TOML parser to safely merge ECC MCP servers into `~/.codex/config.toml`:

- **Add-only by default** — missing ECC servers are appended; existing servers are never modified or removed.
- **7 managed servers** — Supabase, Playwright, Context7, Exa, GitHub, Memory, Sequential Thinking.
- **Package-manager aware** — uses the project's configured package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun) instead of hardcoding `pnpm`.
- **Drift warnings** — if an existing server's config differs from the ECC recommendation, the script logs a warning.
- **`--update-mcp`** — explicitly replaces all ECC-managed servers with the latest recommended config (safely removes subtables like `[mcp_servers.supabase.env]`).
- **User config is always preserved** — custom servers, args, env vars, and credentials outside ECC-managed sections are never touched.

## Multi-Agent Support

Codex now supports multi-agent workflows behind the experimental `features.multi_agent` flag.

- Enable it in `.codex/config.toml` with `[features] multi_agent = true`
- Define project-local roles under `[agents.<name>]`
- Point each role at a TOML layer under `.codex/agents/`
- Use `/agent` inside Codex CLI to inspect and steer child agents

Sample role configs in this repo:
- `.codex/agents/explorer.toml` — read-only evidence gathering
- `.codex/agents/reviewer.toml` — correctness/security review
- `.codex/agents/docs-researcher.toml` — API and release-note verification

## Key Differences from Claude Code

| Feature | Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Hooks | 8+ event types | Not yet supported |
| Context file | CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md | AGENTS.md only |
| Skills | Skills loaded via plugin | `.agents/skills/` directory |
| Commands | `/slash` commands | Instruction-based |
| Agents | Subagent Task tool | Multi-agent via `/agent` and `[agents.<name>]` roles |
| Security | Hook-based enforcement | Instruction + sandbox |
| MCP | Full support | Supported via `config.toml` and `codex mcp add` |

## Security Without Hooks

Since Codex lacks hooks, security enforcement is instruction-based:
1. Always validate inputs at system boundaries
2. Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables
3. Run `npm audit` / `pip audit` before committing
4. Review `git diff` before every push
5. Use `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` in config

**Explore Command Preference:** enabled via `USE_OMX_EXPLORE_CMD` (default-on; opt out with `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`)
- Advisory steering only: agents SHOULD treat `omx explore` as the default first stop for direct inspection and SHOULD reserve `omx sparkshell` for qualifying read-only shell-native tasks.
- For simple file/symbol lookups, use `omx explore` FIRST before attempting full code analysis.
- When the user asks for a simple read-only exploration task (file/symbol/pattern/relationship lookup), strongly prefer `omx explore` as the default surface.
- Explore examples: `omx explore...

**Compaction Protocol:**
Before context compaction, preserve critical state:
1. Write progress checkpoint via state_write MCP tool
2. Save key decisions to notepad via notepad_write_working
3. If context is >80% full, proactively checkpoint state
